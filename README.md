# Language Translator (English - French)
This project uses sequence to sequence model of recurrent neural network to translate any piece of English text to French. I have used recurrent nets because while training on huge data, recurrent nets actually predict the outcome a lot better than any normal machine learning models. In this specific model, the data first passes through an encoder, comes out as an understanding and passes to a decoder. The decoder generates the output.

## How to view the project
1. Simply open the notebook file (dlnd_language_translation_acad.ipynb) in the project by clicking it. 
2. If it is showing any error, may be bacause of slow intenet or other issue open the below link
 
      [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kumar-sam/project-7/blob/master/dlnd_language_translation_acad.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kumar-sam/project-7/blob/master/dlnd_language_translation_acad.ipynb) 

## Installation
To run this project, following library need to be installed inside a local virtual environment

```
conda install numpy
conda install pandas
conda install matplotlib
conda install tensorflow
```
## Running the project
To run this project, first download the notebook file(.ipynb) and extract it. Then set up your conda virtual environment. You may take help from interet for how to setup conda virtual environment.

once you set up virtual enviroment. start the notebook by running the following command in Command prompt(windows).
```
activate environment_name
jupyter notebook
```
You will be redirected to a browser tab. Navigate to the notebook file location through the notebook browser and open it.

once you open the notebook file, just go cell by cell and run it by
```
Ctrl + Enter
Shift + Enter
```
